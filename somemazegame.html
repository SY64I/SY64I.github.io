  <p>In this game, you're stuck in the dark maze with only a flashlight. Your task is to try and collect five purple orbs that are scattered
    around the maze, and escape with your life. However, there are 3 animatronic characters within the maze that are hunting you down. If they
    see you, they'll give chase. If this happens, run as fast as you can or try to hide by crawling into crawl spaces, or else you may get jumpscared!
  </p>
  <p>This game was created as a <b>final project in my Grade 12 Computer Science class</b>, where I was tasked to create a simple 'escape
    the maze' game. The project only asked us to create a maze, and have some sort of monster seek you out in the maze as you try
    and escape. I instead decided to create my maze game with 3 monsters chasing the player, all with <b>state machine determined behavior</b>,
    and with <b>proximity sound systems</b> that make footstep sounds gradually grow louder as they grow closer to you. We had done some state machine behavior coding in
    class, so I wanted to work that into my game, although it wasn't required.
  </p>

  <p> For this project we were allowed to use whatever assets we wanted, and due to my limited modelling knowledge at the time, I decided to use FNAF
    animatronics in the game. Specifically, I chose Freddy, Chica and Foxy (since I wasn't able to rig Bonnie's model correctly). Each has 
    slightly different mechanics: Freddy is an all-rounder, Foxy is the fastest animatronic, and Chica is the slowest animatronic, but she can enter
    crawl spaces that Freddy and Foxy cannot enter.
  </p>
  <p>To dive deeper into the inner workings of each animatronic, all of them have 5 states they can be in. They can be in 'idle' or 'wander' states
    at random to give them semi-random roaming movement. If the player runs near an animatronic, they can 'hear' the player and start walking to their
    location in a 'seek' state. If they player goes through the line-of-sight of an animatronic, the animatronic will enter a 'chase' state to try and
    pursue the player. Finally, if an animatronic reaches the player, they enter a 'kill' state where they jumpscare the player.
  </p>
  <p>Since I wanted to try and make my game scary, I also added in proximity based sound into the game. If a player is far away from an animatronic, either
    they won't hear the animatronic at all, or they'll hear fainter footsteps as they walk around. If an animatronic is closer to the player, the animatronics 
    footsteps will grow louder as they grow closer. This creates a nice audio affect oof the player hearing the animatronics growing closer to the player as they
    give chase, which adds to the scary factor of the game in a nice way.
  </p>
  <p> When I made this project, I wanted my friends in my class to play my game, but they were too afraid to play my game. So I created a separate 
    mode specifically for them called 'Meme Mode'. In this mode, crawl spaces are removed, the level is much brighter, Kevin Macleod plays, and instead of Freddy, Chica and Foxy chasing you, Donkey Kong,
    Waluigi and Sonic chase you instead. The new characters also have simpler AI, as they'll hone in on the player's location if they're close enough to the player
    instead of only when the player runs. This mode was mainly created for fun, and so my friends didn't have any excuse not to play my game (I inevitably made them play
    the normal mode anyway :) ).
