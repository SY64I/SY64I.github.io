  <p>Guide Chisom through the 2D bullet hell game to try and survive and score points. Chisom can fly in 8 directions, and has a dash
    ability that allows them to both kill enemies and be invulnerable to damage. Players have to use the dash tactfully to not only
    kill enemies, but also to fly through enemy bullets if they're stuck in a tight spot. </p>
  <p>This project also features <b>online multiplayer</b>. Using the online hosting service Photon, Chisom offers <b>a room based multiplayer system,</b>
    where players can enter a username and then either create or join rooms other players on the network have created. Once in a room, players can choose
    from four different player colours, and all have to ready up before a match can be started.</p>

  <p>This project was planned to have much more, such as a full singleplayer mode, various online multiplayer modes, and many more different
    environments and gameplay mechanics. However, this project is discontinued for the time being, since at the time I had made the scope of this
    project far too large to be able to complete with the experience I had. Despite this, Chisom does have a fully functioning online server lobby system and does have
    some online multiplayer, although in its current state the multiplayer is still very buggy. I also may still return to this project to try and
    redo this project someday, since I still think the ideas and concepts I had for this project sound fun.
