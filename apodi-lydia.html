  <p>Deep in space, a hummingbird named Lydia (who can breathe in space apparently) is leisurely flying through the depths of space. But then suddenly, she is ambushed by the CAT, aka the Computerized
    Aerial Terror! Lydia has to shoot down the CAT, as she's able to shoot pink lasers from her beak, while also dodging as many of the CATs attacks as possible. Your main goal is to try not to get shot, but this may be hard to do with the different bullet patterns the CAT will attack with. Can you defeat the CAT with 0 deaths?
  </p>
  <p> This game was created for the "Queen's Game Jam 2025" where <b>it won third place overall</b>, winning <b>first place in Graphics, Music and Stability categories</b>.
  All the <b>programming, art and music are my original work</b>, and were all originally created in under 48 hours.

  <p> Going into this project and into the game jam this game was created for, I knew that I had wanted to try and create a bullet hell game despite what theme got chosen. I had
    recently revisited my other project Chisom, and was inspired to have another crack at creating another original bullet hell game, only this time in a much more simplified setting.
    Once the time of the game jam came around, the theme chosen was 'Chaos', which I figured would fit well enough into the type of game I was planning to make. However, seeing that
    the theme was Chaos, I decided to have some fun with developing the project in a chaotic way as well.
  </p>
  <p> While creating this project, although I had the general type of game I wanted to create in mind, I had no setting for the game in mind at all. So I decided to simply create what popped up
    in my head when it came to creating the art. Immediately as the jam started, I thought that a hummingbird being the player could be cool, so I created one. After this, I thought it would be funny
    to have them turn into a fried chicken upon death, so I created a death animation of this fairly quickly. Was this potentially a bad way of creating the art for the game? Maybe, but I had a lot of
    fun creating the game this way, and the resulting setting turned out to be pretty chaotic and distinct.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the jam as I created the project, the main goals I had with the project shifted. Since I had already won the 'Queens Game Jam 2024' the year prior, I wasn't as focused
    on trying to win overall. So I instead focused on winning in the categories I wanted to win in the most, those being in Graphics and Music. Due to this, most of my time creating this project
    during the jam was dedicated to creating the art and music. This did affect my final scores in other categories, such as Theme, Fun/Game Feel, and especially Originality, but in the end I
    won in the categories I wanted to win in. I even excelled in the Graphics and Stability categories, almost receiving perfect scores in each category, and receiving heavy praise for the art from other people in the
    jam.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the jam was over, I watched some of my friends play through the game and noticed that the bullet patterns were much different on their computers than they were on mine. I quickly realised this was
    because I had made a mistake of using Unity's Update() function over its FixedUpdate() function when I created it. This resulted in bullet patterns being dependent on the user's computer, which was
    not intended. So 2 weeks later, I created a small hotfix update addressing that bug. I also added in a few more quality of life features that my friends recommended I add, such as the ability for Lydia to 
    automatically shoot rather than shoot through a button press. As of now this is the most recent update to the game, but I may end up revisiting the game someday to add more to it.
